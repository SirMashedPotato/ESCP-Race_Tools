		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was one of the many excavators working in the local Dwemer ruins. Work there was hard, for one had to be extremely cautions of the surroundings. [PAWN_pronoun] could never be completely sure what was just a statue, and what wasn't. It was tough work, but it was worth it. The pay was good, and [PAWN_nameDef] enjoyed knowing that [PAWN_pronoun] was helping uncover the secrets of the past.</baseDesc>

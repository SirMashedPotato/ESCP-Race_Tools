		<titleShort>poet</titleShort>
		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] always seemed to have a way with words, and as such decided to put it to use as a poet. [PAWN_possessive] lyrical musings often left listeners stunned... usually because they just didn't understand anything [PAWN_pronoun] was saying. Yet after each reading [PAWN_nameDef] would be met with thunderous applause.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was incredibly skilled with [PAWN_possessive] words, and wrote many books that could often be found in someones private library. These books were almost never found  in the residence of some common peasant, as they were needlessly expensive, and somewhat boring. But the nobles liked [PAWN_nameDef]'s work, or at least liked displaying it.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>As a relatively skilled bard, [PAWN_nameDef] would usually be found in a high class establishment, singing the favourite songs of the locals. Annoyingly, this was usually the same three songs. This always disappointed [PAWN_nameDef], as no one ever wanted to hear the songs [PAWN_pronoun] [PAWN_objective]self had carefully constructed.</baseDesc>

One time [PAWN_nameDef] was even meant to take on the role of a maid, but after reading the script [PAWN_pronoun] quickly declined the offer.</baseDesc>

Of course the name [PAWN_nameDef] was enough by itself, and nobles kept coming back for [PAWN_possessive] meals.</baseDesc>

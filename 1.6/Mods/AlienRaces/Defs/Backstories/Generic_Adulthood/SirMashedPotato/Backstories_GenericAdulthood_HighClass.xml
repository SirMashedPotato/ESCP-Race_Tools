		<titleShort>poet</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] always seemed to have a way with words, and as such decided to put it to use as a poet. [PAWN_possessive] lyrical musings often left listeners stunned... usually because they just didn't understand anything [PAWN_pronoun] was saying. Yet after each reading [PAWN_nameDef] would be met with thunderous applause.</description>

		<titleShort>writer</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was incredibly skilled with [PAWN_possessive] words, and wrote many books that could often be found in someones private library. These books were almost never found  in the residence of some common peasant, as they were needlessly expensive, and somewhat boring. But the nobles liked [PAWN_nameDef]'s work, or at least liked displaying it.</description>

		<description>As a relatively skilled bard, [PAWN_nameDef] would usually be found in a high class establishment, singing the favourite songs of the locals. Annoyingly, this was usually the same three songs. This always disappointed [PAWN_nameDef], as no one ever wanted to hear the songs [PAWN_pronoun] [PAWN_objective]self had carefully constructed.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was adept at blending into any role. From a painter, to a soldier, it was as if [PAWN_pronoun] was a completely different person. One time [PAWN_nameDef] was even meant to take on the role of a maid, but after reading the script [PAWN_pronoun] quickly declined the offer.</description>

No one else would ask for [PAWN_nameDef], partly due to the costly prices, but mostly due to [PAWN_nameDef] being extremely 'eccentric'.</description>

While the meals were a sight to look at, most would be hard pressed to tell them apart from 'lesser' dishes based purely on taste. Of course the name [PAWN_nameDef] was enough by itself, and nobles kept coming back for [PAWN_possessive] meals.</description>

A work of art that [PAWN_nameDef] had spent untold moons refining.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was one of the many excavators working in the local Dwemer ruins. Work there was hard, for one had to be extremely cautions of the surroundings. [PAWN_pronoun] could never be completely sure what was just a statue, and what wasn't. It was tough work, but it was worth it. The pay was good, and [PAWN_nameDef] enjoyed knowing that [PAWN_pronoun] was helping uncover the secrets of the past.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] joined the Imperial Archaeological Society thinking [PAWN_pronoun] would spend most days stuck behind a desk, staring at strange rocks and rusted metal. Of course [PAWN_nameDef] was right, but somehow [PAWN_pronoun] wound up enjoying it.</description>

		<description>As a reasonably high ranking member of the Imperial Archaeological Society, [PAWN_nameDef] had the privilege of being sent out into the field, and examining ancient ruins in person. [PAWN_pronoun] uncovered a great many things, including that one really shouldn't pull strange levers in Dwemer ruins.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] decided to join the Imperial Archaeological Society, hoping to spend days translating aged tomes, and inspecting ancient pottery. Thanks to [PAWN_possessive] slight build, and decent skills with a sword, [PAWN_nameDef] was instead tasked with delving into the unknown, and ensuring the ruins were safe for the rest of the field team.</description>
